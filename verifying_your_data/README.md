# Verifying Your Data

The final step, prior to releasing your data, is to thoroughly check it over and make sure everything just looks _right_. This generally means that your data doesn't contain any physiologically impossible values or missing codes. This verificatino is primarily accomplished using the Spout tool, which was discussed in the last chapter, and the [SleepData Staging Server](https://sleepepi.partners.org/edge/sleepdata), which allows us to use graphs to preview the distribution of your data. The following articles will go into greater detail on how to properly utilize these tools to verify that your data are ready to be released.
