# Convert to Markdown

> [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers.

The NSRR has adopted Markdown as the preferred format for writing documentation files and sharing them through the web at sleepdata.org.

The file extension for Markdown is `.md`. Once created, these text files are then converted to HTML for display in a web browser.

As mentioned before, `README.md` in the `pages` folder serves as the basis for one's project documentation. Links to additional documentation pages (i.e. `.md` files) can be made from this initial document.
