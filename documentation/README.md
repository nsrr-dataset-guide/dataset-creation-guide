# Documentation

The first step in preparing a new dataset for the NSRR is to compile a set of documentation about the project. This documentation should give NSRR users a basic level of understanding about the project and the data contained within.

Here is a suggested list of documentation components to share on the NSRR:

1. Project summary
2. Protocols and manuals
3. Case Report Forms, questionnaires, data collection instruments, etc.
4. Relevant publications

**Recommendation:** If possible, spend some time discussing the project with those who worked on it in order to get their input as to where to locate the most relevant bits of documentation for sharing. Compile all of these files (.doc, .pdf, etc.) and establish a rough order before proceeding into the following NSRR-specific steps.

## sleepdata.org Procedures

In order to prepare your documentation for sharing on sleepdata.org, you will have to learn the methods that have been adopted by the NSRR to post and disseminate project documentation.

### [Create a GitHub Repository](create_a_github_repository.md)

Users must create a GitHub repository through which to post and share documentation. This repository is then associated with a dataset on sleepdata.org.

### [Structure Your Documentation](structure_your_documentation.md)

Once a repository has been created, you must conform to the sleepdata.org structure for arranging, organizing, and linking to documentation.

### [Convert to Markdown](create_a_github_repository.md)

While largely optional, we recommend converting as much documentation to [Markdown format](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), as opposed to sharing large, static files (e.g. a 100 page Manual of Procedures).

### [Sync Your Documentation](sync_your_documentation.md)

With your documentation placed on GitHub, the final step is to sync this repository to sleepdata.org.

### [Common Items to Include](common_items_to_include.md)

Different types of data require different types of documentation. Here we have compiled some suggested items for inclusion when sharing datasets through the NSRR.
