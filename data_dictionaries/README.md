# Data Dictionaries

Once documentation for the data have been gathered and a dataset has been prepared, a data dictionary must be created for the study that includes all the variables found in the dataset. This data dictionary will eventually serve as the graphical interface for [sleepdata.org](https://sleepdata.org) and to give other researchers insight into the purpose of each variable. Currently, data dictionaries are created using the JSON file standard. Examples of this will be shown in later chapters.
